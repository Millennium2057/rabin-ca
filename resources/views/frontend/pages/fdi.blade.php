                    <h2>Foreign Direct Investment(FDI)</h2>
                    <p>
                        WHY FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Foreign Direct Investment as the name suggests is an investment venture based in another
                        country than that of the investor’s origin. Foreign Direct Investment plays a vital role in
                        developing economies to a whole new level, with investment in new and emerging markets and
                        providing a global exposure helps a country expand its presence on an international level.
                        Increase in jobs and wages coherently boosts an economy too. In an era where technological
                        advancement leads to greater heights, emerging markets or developing nations are in dire
                        need of being introduced with such technological advancement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Foreign Direct Investment lures toward improvement of infrastructure and a raise in living
                        standard in emerging economies. Nepal, a nation sandwiched amidst two giant nations, namely
                        India and China can undoubtedly be a strategically beneficial economy for investment. FDI is
                        a primary part for effective international economic approach for development. In a nation
                        where FDI flow is outrageously high, the country’s policies for investors are forthcoming,
                        however country’s with unattractive policies the FDI stream will be low.

                    <p>
                        FDI in simpler terms can be seen as the inflows of foreign investment in a country. An
                        inflow of investment will surge the economy of any nation, however the inflow of FDI in
                        Nepal is quite low in comparison to its neighboring countries.
                    </p>

                        Significance of Foreign Direct Investment
                    </p>
                    <p>FDI is regarded as one of the finest contributor to boost economy growth. There has been a
                        sweeping change and developments around the globe and many developing nations lack the
                        funding and better understanding of gaining such transition. Investment made in any foreign
                        firm is regarded as a FDI and acquires a lasting interest; a lasting interest is when the
                        investor attains a 10% of voting power in the firm. As discussed, an investor can expand its
                        business in a foreign country and secure exponential growth, for e.g. Daraz (e-commerce
                        website) is a new venture of e-commerce giant Alibaba in Nepal. Reinvesting in existing
                        companies, joint ventures, acquiring stocks or operating a subsidiary can also be enlisted
                        under Foreign Direct Investment.

                    <p>
                        Foreign Direct Investment comes with loads of perks but the disadvantages tags along and a
                        proper regulated rules and policies in regards to FDI by the host nation can somehow
                        diminish the drawbacks. New entrants such as Alibaba in Nepal has certainly made Daraz one
                        of the top-grossing e-commerce site in Nepal, the input of marketing budget etc. from such
                        larger firms can somehow be substantially difficult for local e-commerce sites to compete
                        with. This can lead to shutdown of the locally grown e-commerce website with the same genre
                        of business.

                        Profit repatriation in layman term can be defined as export of profit back to the investor’s
                        country, leading to large sum of capital outflow from the host nation. An appropriate
                        guideline and mandatory policies needs to be kept in place for such malpractices to
                        diminish.

                        Foreign Direct Investment in Nepal
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        FDI is regarded as one of the core economic source for the development and economic
                        stability in developing nations globally. Nepal is considered as one of the most liberalized
                        nation amidst other South Asian nations, but the inflow of FDI has not recorded a good hike.
                        Nepal is gifted abundantly with natural resources, favorable weather and cheap labors;
                        however the FDI input is not significant enough. In context of Nepal, the Investment Board
                        is the apex body related to accepting proposals for FDI and is chaired by the Prime Minister
                        of Nepal. Polices and plans related to FDI are developed to make the investor foresee the
                        investment friendliness of the country.
